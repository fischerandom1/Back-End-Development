# Dynamic AI Inference Platform

The bridge between AI development and production. Deploy enterprise-grade models in seconds, not days.

## The Problem

Model deployment remains the most significant bottleneck in the AI lifecycle. The complexity of environment matching, dependency management, and infrastructure scaling often requires dedicated Integration and DevOps teams just to move a model from a local environment to a live server.

## Our Solution: Dynamic AI Inference Platform

We’ve built a modern, enterprise-focused alternative to public repositories like Hugging Face. Our platform automates the heavy lifting of containerization and orchestration, allowing data scientists to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.

### How It Works

1. **Define Requirements:** Specify your exact input and output dimensions.
2. **Upload Weights:** Provide your model weights in your preferred format.
3. **Automated Containerization:** Our system automatically builds a secure, optimized container for your model.
4. **Instant Availability:** Your model is live on your private server in **less than 1 minute**.

## Tech Stack

Our platform is built on a robust, scalable architecture designed for high-performance inference:

* **Frontend & Backend:** MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for a seamless, reactive user experience and flexible data management.
* **Containerization:** Docker & Kubernetes for automated scaling and environment isolation.
* **Inference Engine:** Optimized runtime environments for rapid model execution.

## Supported Model Frameworks

The platform is framework-agnostic, supporting the industry's most popular formats:

* **PyTorch:** Direct support for `.pt` and `.pth` files.
* **TensorFlow:** Support for SavedModel and Keras H5 formats.
* **ONNX:** Optimized support for Open Neural Network Exchange models for cross-platform performance.
* **Scikit-Learn:** Easy deployment for traditional machine learning classifiers and regressors.

## Key Features

* **One-Click Deployment:** Streamline your workflow and launch models instantly with a single click.
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Models are secured within your private server environment, ensuring your IP is available only for internal company use.
* **Zero-Config Infrastructure:** No more manual Dockerfile writing or Kubernetes configuration.
* **Rapid Inference:** Optimized for low-latency performance from the moment it goes live.
